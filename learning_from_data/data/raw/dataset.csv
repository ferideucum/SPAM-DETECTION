Another feminist fantasy revenge movie. Yay.,0
So looking forward to this,0
girllll bossss another rey skywalker.....,0
This movie needs to be played in all HR meetings where all boses/managers are present.,0
"Please don't watch this. It's filled with all kinds of evil, and a portal for demons to get into your mind",0
Irene Adler is back,0
looks like a Misery remake on a desert island.,0
untill 1 month i'm ready i am stay here,0
Castaway with Ben Shapiro,0
Seems a lot like Triangle of Sadness,0
He is so fineeeeee,0
"Those of you going on about,""Triangle of Sadness"" ... Kindly google The Admirable Crichton.",0
Yeah. I like Girl Boss! White man bad! How refreshing .. And brave!!,0
I don’t know who’s right or wrong in this,0
it was fantastic i am thrilled with this trailer,0
"I swear I watch this trailer in the theater, completely bored and uninterested thinking to myself ""oh another badly done modern film with crappy writing"" until I saw ""from Sam Raimi"", I'm not kidding, I audibly said ""I beg your pardon, what?""",0
The king is back.!!!,0
being stuck on a deserted island with any boss is hell,0
Didn’t triangle of sadness already do this?,0
Thank you movie maker for not casting Sweeney.,0
We need another Cillian-Rachel movie,0
they made my celebrity crush look homely. hard pass,0
Who writes this garbage?,0
"A story where the man is a useless idiot and the woman is the saviour. On a desert island lol. Where literally every instance of history disproves that this would ever be the case lol. More woke, identity politics, fake bullshit. The woman would be crying and hysterical and not able to do anything at all. Physically and mentally incapable of being a “saviour” in this situation. Reality shows, history, biological facts and reality has established this unequivocally. Watch survivor. See how the women do alone every single time. Literally every single time.",0
Horrible Bosses meets Misery.,0
Bit of a Rachel fan so will give this one a chance.,0
Cast Away meets Misery. Absolutely stoked for this,0
total miscast on o'brien. looks way too young to play the boss.,0
DYLAN!! with rachel omg!!,0
I’m going to like this movie! 😁😁😁,0
"""Do you know the definition of insanity""",0
Who said that is NOT a romantic comedy? 😂😂😂,0
"My own personal island, sounds great",0
"Oh boy! Another girl boss movie. How fun. Woman are strong and don't need no man! lol. Okay, I watched the whole thing. It peaked my interest. The horror twist might make it alright.",0
"100% fantasy. They did test women and men on a deserted island. Men did fine, the women almost deleted twice in a few weeks.",0
Chill out incel,0
Chill out it’s only a movie,0
"You need help if you want to go see this, and I'm a fan of both of these actors.",0
"Send help!!!!! but not for me, ahh trailer",0
it's like another version of the last chapter of triangle of sadness,0
Is Dylan over acting to anyone else? Let's reconvene when the movie comes out.,0
Even the trailer is horrifying man😬,0
I'm guessing she had fun with this character as she didn’t have to look glamourized and perfect all of the time like The Notebook.,0
I’ve met Rachel in person and she is stunning.,0
I absolutely love revenge stories.,0
now this is amazing,0
I'm foolishly excited to see the movie even though I totally know the plot,0
"I hope she wins her vengeance, hahaha",0
"Oh, why am I on her side?",0
I thought that was Rebecca Hall,0
Not a fan of all the new 'messed up in the head' movies coming out.,0
"Can't wait for those Jesterbell videos on this film, saying that this is a girlboss movie on steroids. NOT!",0
"Lord, I hope she kills him and then gets rescued😃",0
"we should do ""Get Help"" next..",0
This may be the first movie since Spiderman I think I will go watch in theaters,0
I'd have taken him out and acted like the crash did it.,0
I love Dylan O'brien i think hes an underrated actor so I'll definitely be watching this,0
"I don't understand the point? Of course I'm with Rachael McAdams. She could be a literal psychopath, but that guy would be the bigger psychopath still. It's going to be annoying if the movie shows him as somehow a good guy and she as deranged. These CEOs are literally vultures that feed off the planet irl",0
Watching for the survival skills.,0
Oh great yet another girl boss film no thanks,0
Misery meets Castaway,0
I haven't seen Rachel MacAdams in years- a wonderful actress.,0
"Misery…Tropical Style…oh,ok",0
"1:29 We’re not in the office anymore, Bradley. 10/10 line",0
2:00 Dylan is really a great actor,0
"He was mean boy, but she's the ""meaner girl""",0
Go and watch a boy boss movie then 😂,0
The outfit Dylan’s wearing while laying on the plants looks a lot like his outfit in maze runner 😂,0
"Rachel McAdams is back baby!! Man, I hope this is good.",0
All I know is Rachel isn't the villain.,0
"Two actors that i appreciate so much no matter what the story is,I'm sat 🤞",0
Woman power! Lol. Will stream it somewhere.,0
Schrodinger's feminist; a woman is both victimized and empowered until something happens and she determines which benefits her the most.,0
Never thought you could make Rachel McAdams look that average.,0
"“Regina George is flawless.” “If Regina George wears army pants and flip flops, everyone wears army pants and flip flops.”",0
"Should have named it SOS, but i'll watch it at some point. Not in a Theatre though...",0
"When do they make friends with volleyball and yell ""WILSOOOON""?",0
I am wanting this for dinner tonight so here I am .. with u I know my family will b happy ty ty ❤,0
I love this I tryed the first and second one they was so good!,0
"I thought traditional cottage pie was lamb ,and shepherds pie was beef?",0
Nice tasty helthy food🌹🌹🌹,0
Man this is the 5th time im back here i just love thos recepe,0
Can i make a double batch of the meat/veg/stock and freeze it?,0
"Hi Adam, I'm working my way through your recipes, done chilli con carie, spaghetti bol (ibthink that was yours) and this week sauage pie, which isnt a pie because theres no pastry, but its good. I make a big batch at weekend and it sees me through the week. Brilliant channel👍",0
"Interesting video watched to the end good recipe I am going to make it and might use just a bit of shin with the mince, not sure what potatoes i have a choice in garden to choose from. thank you",0
"Wow, I have to try this once it gets a bit cooler.",0
Absolutely brilliant. Such a good tip not to add chopped tomatoes or tomato puré. Thanks Adam !,0
"Mmmm!!! Think I’ll try this with beef shin, it looks beautiful. I make it just like yours Adam but never used anything but mince so going to find a nice butcher and get some beef shin, it’s probably expensive but going to give it a go anyway.",0
when i was 16 and my parents got divorced it was just me and my dad so every friday we would make a point of cooking a cottage pie together as an end of week meal so this recipe brings back soooo many memories,0
"Looks great, Adam. I'm just about to put mine in the oven with extra mature cheddar on the top, nom nom👍",0
What temp should oven be? 😊,0
"Hi Adam, your beef that your using in the recipe is leg of beef not shin .though very similar the leg has a lot less conective tissue and will therefore be a lot tenderer and cook quicker.yours david ex butcher (50 + years).",0
"The meat was cheaper than any supermarket , really?",0
From here on I will always do shin beef rather than mince......this is amazing,0
Thank you made this to night for the wife we loved it. 😍,0
How do you get 550 ml from those little pots do you put more than one 🤔😬,0
Other way round mate,0
I really have to look at these older ones from long before I found this channel:),0
What a lovely memory to have,0
Cheese is elite on a cottage pie 😋,0
I'd say around 180°c mate,0
Really? It's what I asked my butcher for. I'll have to have words 😂,0
"Hi again Adam ,the leg of beef that you received instead of the shin was an upgrade.l personaly would not recommend anyone use shin for this type of recipe,so in a backhanded way he did you a favour.good luck with your channel and bon appetit.regards David",0
This just appeared along with your latest one on my home screen. Definitely trying it!,0
Absolutely fabulous! Watched the Gordon Ramsey version.. not a patch on this!,0
"Authentic healthy recipe (leaving out the butter), no heaps of cheese, no garlic, no tomato paste. Just real authentic cottage pie, thanks very much! I know what I'll be having this Sunday dinner.",0
Got my ingredients at the the ready 👌🏻,0
"I'm a new subscriber and I'm working my way though your videos, we seem to cook the same meals but really enjoy your take on them! And i really enjoy doing them your way! 🙌",0
Amen to no tomato products. And double amen on chopping your own beef. This is a great video. Question: adding Brussels sprouts in the mix?,0
"Hey YouTube is showing me your older vids now. Glad to watch, thought I watched all of them. This looked delicious!",0
Would Slartibartfast recommend it ?,0
"That looks lush, and someone who knows his cottage pie from his shepherds pie!",0
"This is a bit off topic but I have found sweetcorn added to stews, mince, pasties, etc.makes quite a difference.",0
Thanks for no tomato 👍🏻Adam x,0
What is the pie dish size that you are using ?,0
That looks amazing - at last ! - -someone cooking without the need for any fancy distracting flavours - -just lovely simple home cooking-thank you!!!!!!,0
I thought with mashed potatoes on top was called Shepards Pie and with cheesy scalloped potatoes it was called Cottage Pie?,0
"Oh my goodness, that looked delicious. The quality of that shin of beef must have been amazing. Big pea-size though! Thank you so much for posting this. I shall certainly give this one a try...👍",0
"Yes, I found a chef that won't add all the fancy ingredients, like wine and garlic. You made a wonderful old fashioned pie as it should be lots of yummy golden mash. Yours is the best recipe.",0
cannot wait to try this!,0
"Bit of cheese in the mash, yum",0
Like your vids. I have already cooked some of your recipes. Important for me to learn KITCHEN ENGLISCH as well. Easy for me to understand you. Best wishes From Reinhard YOUR FAN FROM GERMANY,0
Tweet Gordon and tell him he sucks from me. 🤣,0
Welcome aboard! We're a close little family here. Great to have you 😊,0
Thank you. You could add sprouts if you like. Although sounds odd to me. But you do you 😂😉,0
YouTube suggests more of my content the more you watch. So you must be watching a fair few of my vids. 😂❤️,0
You know it. Everyday 😎,0
Thank you for watching. Have s great day 🙂,0
"Shepherds pie is made with lamb, cottage pie is made with beef. Both have a mash topping, and it must be crisp on top. Both are made in very similar ways, just the meat is different.",0
"Cheers Danny, it's one of my favourite meals 🙂",0
"Barbara, you're a sweetheart. Thank you for the kind words! x",0
"Awesome bud! Glad you enjoy the channel. Also of you have any nice German recipes, send them my way. 🙂",0
Favorite german dish RINDERROULADE many recipies on youtube,0
Look youtube CALLE KOCHT Profi cook explaining art of Grand Mother cooking,0
Who on earth uses tomato based ingredients in a cottage pie. Not in my lifetime. Man having this tomorrow,0
"I have made this today. It was delicious. I learned from you, not using any tomatoes or tomato puree. When beef are well cooked let it shrink & cold, then only fill up the mashed potatoes. Thank you & do you publish recipe book, I'll order for self & send to my friends as gift as well. Greeting from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",0
Looks awesome. Great informative video.,0
I used shin beef and steak mince (more people were having supper than I’d got enough shin for )The results fantastic made a lovely contrast of meaty texture,0
"Ahhh..... Now this was the kinda flavour I was wanting for my mince to be,for a mince beef cobbler. Thanks.",0
Now that's PROPER!,0
Is this what I used to call shepherds pie? Or was I just wrong the whole time?,0
"PS, itemising the ingredients is a real bonus for we novice cooks ~ as we can get in and out of the supermarket with the minimum of fuss.!! Thanks again",0
"Adam ~ my New Year resolution for 2018 was 'no more ready meals'..... followed your Chilli Con Carne recipe (far, far better than M&S!!) and will now try the good old cottage pie. As a 74yr. 1st time cook and am so pleased to have found your videos. Pls. keep them coming ............. Thanks",0
"Might have found the perfect cottage pie recipe, looks delicious, thanks I’ll try this for Sunday lunch.",0
Amazing color. much better than store bought prepackaged.,0
I'm going to give it a go but I'm wondering what shin beef is called in the USA or at least a good substitute for it 🙂,0
"Another great one, I've been telling myself to try this dish, I'm not British so never had a chance and this looks like an awesome way to do it. Thanks Adam",0
"oh god, I haven't had breakfast and this makes me soooo hungryyyyy",0
"We have the same sieve! Probably too excited about that. That pie looks delicious, I would have added some cheese to that mash though because cheese should go in everything =]",0
Not sure why but I add cheese to the top of my mash and grill it for 1 minute or so. But other than that mine is pretty similar but never used shin beef! Think I'll try it. Another great video mate,0
shin beef is one of the best cuts of beef....but Adam i challenge you to use beef cheek instead now that will kick the shin right out of the water. Anyway good job my friend😉,0
Adam mate I think your recipe is very close to how the pie was made back in the day on the farm. The farmer only had what was in his garden and not the more posh ingredients we have access to today.,0
I see it in so many recipes and u don't know why. It's not a Bolognese 🙄,0
"I agree, I don't think they put in tomato paste and garlic back in the day, I know my mother never did we never even had garlic in the house maybe that's why I dislike it so much, it's so potent and smells horrible. No I am not a vampire.lol",0
"Awww thank you so much! you're a sweetheart! I'm just glad you enjoyed it all the way from Malaysia! Thats amazing! Well, hopefully one day yes i'll have a cookbook. happy new year to you and your family :)",0
@Adam_Garratt Happy New Year 20\9 & keep it up!!,0
Nice one David! Glad you enjoyed it pal,0
Shepherds pie is basically the same but is made with lamb. Cottage pie is made with beef.,0
Adams Eats I surely never have used lamb for mine so thanks for the clarification ^-^ I always did mine the same as you did in this video but in the minced beef option. Sometimes I also put edamer cheese on top... Does that still leave it as a cottage pie or is it completely wrong to keep the name for this version?,0
"@Adam_Garratt I once read that if you add tomato to a Cottage Pie it becomes a London Pie. Your recipe is so similar to mine that we could probably each claim to have had it stolen! Although I tend to use mixed herbs for Cottage Pie and Thyme for Shepherds. I have to confess that I have always used good quality mince, though I am tempted to try the shin. What cut of lamb would you use for Shepherds pie? As a child, my mother used to mince up left over roast beef and onion - now that was tasty! I also tend to boil the carrots and celery for about 2-3 minutes in the minimum of unsalted water before adding them to the frying onions. The boiling liquor is then reduced a little if there is too much for the stock - it is surprising just how much flavour goes into the water! One trick I have found for getting a good topping (apart from allowing the mixture to go cold which I also have found to be a must) is to just put a ring of potato around the edge and push it hard against the dish (with a knife) which usually stops or at least significantly reduces leakage at the edge (the main culprit for messing up the oven tray I put it on), and then fill the centre and press that down well. As for the top, I tend to use a fork to create an effect like a ploughed field which not only consolidates the top, it gives lots of nice crispy bits. If I have time (usually the case) I do a kind of basket weave pattern on the top - doesn't taste any better, but looks good, especially if you serve it in individual dishes. Regardless of the pattern I always do a single 'ploughed' ring with a fork around the edge.",0
That's awesome Bert! So glad you enjoy the videos ☺,0
"kevin conroy hope you like it Kevin, let me know how you get on!",0
+SAB8 cheers bud. Yeah store bought cottage pie tends to be bland and boring to me.,0
Thanks,0
Brenda Rigdon You could use any slow cooking meat really. Beef shin is also known as shank too. Chuck would also be a good alternative ☺,0
"Petra Kujundžić you're too sweet Petra. Thank you very much. it's a classic, and very tasty. ☺",0
CountingStars Haha thank you glad you like it ☺,0

"I was surprised with how funny and chill this guy is, legit dude.",0
50 dollars would be nice,0
dude absolutely FUMBLED asta suffers,0
I think we know what his therapy was.,0
last girl and him are a perfect match ngl.,0
WHY ARE ALL.THE GIRLS SO HOTTT!!!,0
That transition was crazy after he said some stuff about himself then he appeared out from behind him😂❤,0
First eliminated was a step down not a glow up,0
this guy is so chill omg,0
Dressed down dating..,0
"30:48 ""damn bro that hit harder than my dad!"" 😅",0
Wow,0
I like that he seems more interested in personality as opposed to looks,0
bro is a stereotype of a “modern” man.,0
asta was so hot bro what 💔,0
7 was a downgrade.,0
The first one looked better on the photo,0
"Few questions - 1.first girl was definitely a glow down. who directed this video? 2. neck tattoo girl, why didnt they do it along her jawline???",0
"The delusion is real, they are all 10s in their own eyes, Glad he picked the most down to earth and feminine girl.",0
Dude is allergic to beauty,0
"There were maybe two girls, the final two, without tattoos. They may have been covered up or hidden.",0
Girl with the spilt tongue and tatoos probably has major trauma she needs to move through,0
"BRUH ALL OF THEM WERE HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT, LIKE TFFFFF my fav was the first and the last also, good choice lad",0
Best video ever” blind dating blind girls by my appearance”,0
is that the guy from sugar crush? the cooking show on netflix?,0
Aysia was the prettiest looking imao,0
"All of them were baddies, but I think he chose the perfect girl for himself lol",0
they all looked better before... OMG..,0
I’d be a bowl of chicken nuggys,0
Alize shoes are fire,0
He really messed up,0
He liked the girl in the red shirt.,0
"What a shame, the girl with the neck tatoo is so pretty.",0
"Also, WHAT THE HECK, ASKING A TEENAGE GIRL WHO THREW AWAY A PULL-UP?!?! That mom should be flayed alive.",0
Y'know what? This guy seems like a sweet gentleman.,0
When it flashed to the train guy I screamedddd,0
I love that girl with white hair omg,0
Why about India 😭🥲🙏,0
"Nr. 7 didn't cheat, she actually got worse looking 😅",0
is he supposed to be a trophy. the naked talking toes are cheating a bit.,0
Lure can I find this guy? 👀 asking for a friend,0
25:46 such a true friend damn,0
But… did he actually go on a date with her??,0
Asta was the hottest in my own opinion but all girls were very beautiful ❤️,0
He seems like a chill guy 💗,0
First girl eliminated was the baddest.,0
Im a straight woman but COME ON MAN ASTA IS HOT,0
They looked like a bunch of homeless behind those curtains,0
I’m sad he’s not still with the girl who was learning to speak Greek.,0
"Considering that tattoos and piercings are red flags for me, I'd say he got rather lucky.",0
Caught my single ass smiling mb for existing tho ✌😔,0
WTF are with these outfits? Clearly I'm too old. That guys pants look like clown wear and that first girls were about the match. Absolutely terrible,0
Split tongue will be sigle for ever lol,0
F for this champ,0
All of them are BUT ASTA IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY,0
by glowing up don't you mean GROWING up?? what kind of retarded framing is this premise for an episode,0
u gotta be retarded to eliminate the prettiest blond and no the behemoth with tattos first,0
31:19 that’s a both mommy,0
knew he'll choose her since first few minutes ❤️,0
"can i have the 50 im the 13,483rd comment",0
The leg press bit sent me😂😂😂,0
The big ol tidies flashback sent me 😂😂😂,0
these girls were hoes,0
I want an update,0
After he was saying the number 1 and 2 names again he said it wrong and she said asta and I think I heard her say bitch lol mumbling..,0
“And kids that’s how I met your mother”,0
Id honestly say the girl that got elimated first looked better in her photo than she actually does now. Idk maybe im getting old. I miss when people looked like people and not trying to look like they are superficially younger than they are. Why does everyone feel like they gotta be so extra these days. Must be exhausting to feel like you need to change a million things about yourself to be percieved by others differently.,0
"I really hope it works out!! But, the chick who said she gets unsolicited attention from men, over her tongue…lie! You only do some shit like that for attention!!",0
As soon as I saw those cute french pedicured toenails I guessed he'd pick her- I was right!,0
ITS THE TESSALHYDRA,0
I m not sure but I thing hanry is also want to going home . May be he forgot some her memory...and I think he stuck in wormhole ...May be I m wrong ...,0
Wait it’s not the dragon,0
hope I don't see these actors again,0
Hey can I be a random demogorgon,0
BYLER SHIP IS NOT HAPPENING ITS CONFIREMED!,0
I'll prepare my heart for the heartbreak.,0
Boycott stranger things,0
soo uhh why is steve not in the trailer and why is dustin crying.....??,0
I need a 10 min clip of this trailer music . Holy shmoly,0
"So Kali is a horrible addition to the show and you decided to put her in the thumbnail, too? It's rage-baiting at this point.",0
"idk how to feel going to miss Stranger Things!! It’s the show my brother and I both watch 🥰 I love Will and Robin! Also, Delightful Derek.",0
If only it didn't take 10 years to get here.,0
My god this is gonna be so sad someone important is gonna die 100% GET FOOD WATER AND TISSUES,0
If Steve will die I will cry😭,0
Come on duffer brothers.. please do it more season of stranger things..i fully enjoy watching this drama.. everything is perfect.. from storyline..cast.. cameraman.. sounds effect.. visual effects..CGI..all things about it.. perfect..i hope they continue to make a season 6..😊,0
okay i honestly didnt expect the abyss to ACTUALLY come down onto hawkins wtf,0
This is the best show I've ever seen in my life! I can only nitpick on one thing though. Eddie should have played a Dio song instead of Metallica on top of the trailer. It was 1986. Dio was the biggest thing in Metal and Eddie wore a Dio patch on his jacket. I was expecting We Rock not Master of Puppets. I'm out.,0
Bro one of the main characters needs to die if not I’m going to crash out. They need a very sad death,0
Why Dustin is crying…😢omg 😭😭😭,0
Bro i am damn sure that there ia vecan behind hopper on this time - 0:55 those who can see 👇,0
WHERE IS STEVE HARRINGTON 😭,0
Is it time to bet on Ted Wheeler who will actually end this.,0
When the final episode will realase in Netflix,0
Holy s*** the mind flair is back 😢,0
I’m finding this last season so confusing….,0
How the hell they gonna fitt everthing with one episode,0
Where is Steve 😡 why haven't you show him in this trailer,0
0:51 only says one thing in my head Steve dies,0
"Stop milking bro, last 3 episodes were literally fillers",0
"If Steve is dying, I’m dying too. Please Duffers, save him one last time 🤧🤞",0
WAAAAAAAIT I'M NOT READY!!,0
It’s over today,0
Only close to less than 11 hrs to go. We will miss u ST and we will miss you Steve (Hair) Harrington specially 😔,0
steve is gonna die look at dustin someone holding him back if u look at hopper he is wearing the same bag as the person holding him back and who would scream and try to save someone except if there really close so steve is gonna die in a explosion 0:51,0
Yes. Lets end this..,0
"The last 2 episodes have been laughably bad. Meandering, pandering, boring gobbledygook. What the hell happened?",0
One last time I am waiting,0
Plot twist: it was the government experiments that made them gay,0
Can’t believe my childhood is coming to an end.,0
"I swear if anything happens to steve and dustin, imma ball out by crying 😭",0
No Netflix i need more stranger things,0
"0:51, wait that wasn't Ai...",0
IM NOT READY TO SAY GOODBYE😭😭😭,0
Who else is excited for this one,0
First 4 : awesome Next 3: awful Finale : hopefully good,0
Damn bro it’s actually ending tn 😢😔,0
Dustin screaming at 0:51 makes me very concerned for Steve 🥲,0
"Treasure these last few hours of anticipation bc after that, it’s all over. What a fantastic show and to have us all watch at the end of the year 🎊",0
Army coming to upside down Hawkins is pretty worrying. Our party got already many on plate to fight 🥲 Fight with Vecna Fight with Henry's aka Vecna's memory lanes & now memories Fight with demodogs / abyss's monsters Fight with shadow monster Fight with Dr K's Army,0
I never wanna see a serious divided this way again. This was total crap Netflix!,0

"Season 5 has been rather weak, with WAY too much silly exposition and repeaters of stuff we’ve already seen - so many damn times! And all of the side-characters are irritating as well (I think I’m rooting for VECNA at this point 🤷‍♂️) Praying the final episode brings it, cause they need to do a lot to truly finish STRONG at this point (I write that as a FAN) Crossing fingers 🤞",0

"Good morning everyone! It's actually noon in Izmir, Turkey because i overslept- again. I was feeling bad about it and blaming myself for sleeping this much. But I've been having a hard time lately as I graduated and having a gap year, not knowing what to do next. I had to left the city i studied, Istanbul, and I miss there so much. But reading these comments, I once again realized that all of us deal with different things at different stages of our lives. So, it's okey to feel left behind and feel like we don't know what to do with our lives. It's just a state, it'll pass. Have a lovely day everyone, and don't forget to be grateful for little beautiful things you have in your life 🍁🧡",0

Idk man I got a feeling this will be a underrated sleeper,0
Looks garbage and a insult too the legendary wonder man .,0
Your process can go blow a spider 😂,0
thanks for more ai content,0
"Thanks, but no thanks",0
Why is the screen black?,0
I’m very confused and excited,0
"AWWWW! I was hoping that the woman saying ""Pretty sure he used to be a terrorist"" was Mish Wittrup! Not sure it is anymore.",0
"So, a not superhero show.",0
"Now that's a trailer. You set up the main characters, show a brief explanation of what we might see and then end it. Finally, dammit.",0
"Another case of race swapping because apparently Marvel doesn't like white male characters. Simon Williams is supposed to be white. Disney and Marvel are supposed to be good at storytelling of the modern myths under their care. Guess they are wrong on all three cases. As long as this company continues to hate me for how I was born, I will not hate it in return. But I will not give it my money.",0
Wait huh? So he really isn’t a superhero? I feel like I just watched the trailer for parks and rec 🤦🏽‍♂️,0
Bull from iron man 3 ahhhhh,0
No ones watching this,0
Why am I seeing this after 2 months,0
"Scarlet Witch fans, Just know, if Wanda does comeback - this is gonna be the dude that’s cracking her 😂😂 comic heads know what I’m talking about",0
"In the Prime MARVEL Universe (comics), Hunter the White Wolf is Black and he's T'Challa's, Shuri's & Jakarra's adopted sibling. In the MARVEL Cinematic Universe, the White Wolf is the Winter Soldier/James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes.",0
"​@albertorojas4278 1) My point of reference is comics from first half of the 1990's. 2) Disney and Marvel have proven through behavior patterns and has been shown through reporting to be heavily biased against anything straight white male. 3) I find it equally important to not do race and gender swaps, no matter what direction it goes. Keep to the lore. Keep personal issues and politics out.",0
What is this junk?,0
"I agree with the comments, this is copying the movie Birdman. But super watered down and worse.",0

it is marvel flim ?😯,0
"A little on the nose, don't you think?",0
I think chang chi is in the movie,0
People on here keep making references to the latest Superman as if it was a good movie. I could barely remember the plot,0
“Everyone is tired of superheroes” - President of Boravia (he just doesn’t like Superman & the justice gang),0
The actor auditioned for a role to be an actor that auditions for a role 💀,0
Sooo… does anyone have superpowers?,0
"Moon Knight (S2) was never announced, let alone cancelled.",0
*flim film Wonder Man is a television miniseries.,0
It was indeed a better movie,0
"Watch, Wonder Man (January 27, 2026) to find out.",0
didn’t even know about this,0
This looks like an episode of the studio,0
I would say Steve Rogers is retired to Be Captain America In Avengers Endgame To Be Old,0
"Wow, this looks terrible",0
I know Marvel is doing better than Dcu..but why are they always taking actors from dcu? Obsessive behaviour,0
😒😒😒 no idea it is what,0
Bro what the heck is this 💀🥀,0
"1:57 haha it kinda looks like they kept a blooper in the trailer, I bet that guy ate a block of cheese before doing that scene",0
Why do I feel like it's not gonna be anything like the comic,0
Hold up.... LEO as in Leonardo Dicaprio is CANON in MCU?,0
So a movie only for Hollywood insiders? This will bomb,0
What's Kenya East doing here?,0
I'm acc so done with Marvel at this point. Just miss after miss after miss. They got the aim of a stormtrooper which is funny cause they can't even write them correctly,0
This looks so bad,0
That's what Von Kovak would say About Steve Rogers As Captain America In Avengers Endgame,0
What is wrong with Disney? 😔,0
DC Studios has casted actors that appeared in the MCU first as well.,0
0 people here watched the Watchmen show lol,0
Looks really boring,0
"Idk what to make of this but if bro nailed the audition, maybe? 🤷🏽‍♂️🤣",0
They fumbled not letting nathan fillion be wonderman,0
But dose he have any super powers what dose this have to do with marvel,0

Wonder fail. How much of the same can the audience get excited formula. It is the same movie again and again,0
Beast should be here…,0
And the crowd goes mild,0
I'd rather watch Anthony Mackie fight Red Hulk again,0
How is this even a marvel show?? 😂,0
Is that guy from Superman? The president of boravia,0
Wow.. this isn’t anything how I thought “wonder man” from marvel would look.. does he have powers? Does he get them after he starts filming the part for the dude.. I’m confused and why would marvel intentionally do this to a black male lead……… this trailer was pretty underwhelming,0
i see the mandarin😂,0
"*dose does Watch, Wonder Man (January 27, 2026) to find out.",0
@albertorojas4278 I was joking because it’s the same actor,0
"@albertorojas4278 definitely gonna watch, just wondering why they’re intentionally putting out uninteresting trailers-",0
Jesus Christ. How have they STILL not learned their lesson?!,0
This Disney race swapping is ridiculous and to add this trailer was terrible. If this is the way they are taking this then its going to fail.,0

This Ultimate Gym Workout Mix just helped me add 20lbs to my deadlift! Absolute FIRE! 🔥,0

I will never understand why my torso and proximal limbs have visible fat but my calves are the most muscular shit Ive ever seen...,0
This advice is literally for ANY height. The height thing is really not as much as a variable as internet influencers make it out to be. This video is pretty misinformed and full of holes regarding the whole “pros and cons to being petite”. We don’t need more of this garbage circulating the internet.,0
very informative. thank you.,0
But I never go to gym,0
I'm 16 and I'm 4'11 I've been wanting to loss weight for a long time now I wanna know if its gonna work,0
"As a 5'2 woman in my 30s I went from an XXL to toned XS in 6 months in 2023, and maintained ever since. But I didn't do any of this :o I think this advice might be best for younger women, especially prior to having kids.",0
1:47 this actually makes me feel less guilty next time when i eat out and I don’t wanna overstuff myself just to finish everything. Thank you for the reminder❤,0

I'm petite 5'0ft and i am indeed full of stretch mark :((,0
"as a petite woman it really is eating less... you don't need to eat 3 meals a day. I eat 1-2. That's the only way I can lose weight, and no it's not unhealthy... we need less because we're smaller. A chihuhuhua doesn't eat the same amount of food as a german shepherd.",0
ok before starting watching the video i wanna say that you are soooo pretty,0
I’m a 30 year old mom looking to loose the baby weight. What did you do?,0
"ikr.. I was raised to finish my food and feel almost guilty if I cant, or I feel the need to eat it all now because we dont get regular breaks at my job!! I could prevent myself from getting hungry again for longer if I overate a bit so thats why I did that... or I dont want to deal with food waste or leftovers that go bad, especially in a country where many people are literally starving and youre lucky to have your basic needs met",0
"A lot of this weight loss shit about fasting and caloric deficit was made by studying men, it's outdated. Calories in calories out is how they thought bodies ran if it was a dumb machine, it doesn't account for the fact that the body is intelligent enough to partition 1900 calories differently depending on one's lifestyle. It doesn't account for the fact that your body does not LIKE having to make do with 1200 calories when the brain and your eyes can LITERALLY see we are living in an age of abundance. If you were in the middle of a desert with ZERO food and can only get 1200 calories, then your body will be forced to function on that but people underestimate the fact that we can literally order food and have it delivered, and we literally have stocked pantries 24/7. Your lizard brain WILL FIND A WAY to get you to eat the calories that it wants you to eat, and your willpower to resist it IS FINITE literally the hormone that controls motivation gets depleted, you will not be able to keep it up.",0
"As a 5'2"" woman who actually went from obese to XS in 6 months and has maintained for over two years now, a lot of what you're saying is utterly inaccurate. Even at my MOST active, the amount of calories you're saying we need to eat will cause me to rapidly regain weight and become obese again. Same is true of almost all small women unless they somehow have a magically fast metabolism.",0
I am 5'9 feet but I am still growing and 18years old boy😊,0

more on reverse dieting please!,0
I’m 5’0 119. I lost 10 lbs recently but want to go down to 109,0
Ah I’m 5’5 but I experience the same struggle,0
It feels weird that the average height is called petite (in the US),0
"Actually this is sad, I’m 154cm :(",0
"I always thought I was quite tall as my friends growing up were all about 5ft for some reason, so I always assumed my maintenance should be high. I’ve only just some to realise that I’m not tall and leggy I’m 5ft 4 and I’ve been struggling to be lean because I’m overeating 😢",0
I’m 4’11” apparently I’m screwed…,0
I'm 5 flat and very flabby 😢,0
"I'm 5'4 and have never been ""petite"" unless I was thin with no muscle.",0
"I’m 158cm, was always in the skinny side like 42-45kg, then i started to eat a lot in the hope of developing fat to become healthier and to look good to wear m sized clothes, I’m 50kg now and the fat developed only at my belly area 😂, although My body looks ideal but my belly fat starting to make me feel discomfort, like the rolls are quite showing and when i tried to bend i feel suffocated, trying to go back to my past diet but it’s hard cuz I’ve already accustomed to current diet, like if i ate less it won’t satisfy me and made me feel uneasy 😅",0
Thank you! As a 4'11 girlie who until recently believed cardio was the most important factor to losing weight and becoming toned.. this was something I needed to hear. I'm quite small but I was walking 2 hours every day + 20 minutes of intense cardio.. it wasn't sustainable.,0
watching as a 5’1 guy wish me luck,0
I don't want to lose weight. I want to lose the fat and gain it in muscle whilst retaining my weight (it's fine to weight more as well as long as it's in muscle). How would one approach this?,0
I just want to remove stomach fat. All of the other fat is very welcome. Especially in the higher and lower places.,0
You need a limb lengthing surgery for getting taller to 6'1feet,0
"4'10"" over here 👋🏻 let me ask you... If I haven't hit my goal within 16 weeks do you recommend I stay in a calorie deficit? I have about 50 pounds to lose. No way am I doing it in 16 weeks 😂 I go to the gym 2-4 times a week doing strength & conditioning, HIIT workouts and eat a high protein (.8-1g/lb), high fiber diet while maintaining a deficit but I'm stagnant.. not losing weight, just maintaining. It's defeating some days. And then on days like today where I find your video I feel justified that it's fricken hard out here for the shorties!!!!",0
"honestly I found it's way easier to do a body recomp (or even be in a surplus to gain muscle faster) first, and enter a cutting phase after that. I understand that some people don't want to look ""fatter"" as they actually progress but gaining muscle is easier in a surplus and losing fat is actually easier with more muscle mass as your maintenance calories are higher",0
"I’m 5’1 and since I started dating my boyfriend over 1.5 years ago, I’ve gained about 10 pounds but that 10 pounds showed up as an extra 3 inches on my waist and some fat buildup on my calves and arms. I only weight 110 but don’t think I look it right now. Hoping to tone up a bit",0
That’s how I’m 5’11 and 80kg and ppl still say I look slim,0
"I'm 5'8"" and keep having to lower and lower how much I eat. I can't lose any weight...",0
"i guess (?) me being an obese petite might show more weightloss with these tips since i have more to lose, but do i also do it for 16 weeks weeks and the reverse diet for 4-12 weeks, then start again for 16 weeks?",0
But that’s the thing when I’m super active I need way more food like I cannot function properly unless I eat a lot when I’m being super active so I actually ended up gaining weight so now I’m not very active and eat like one meal a day and tahts the only way I’ve lost weight,0
This video is filled with so much misinformation,0
I just love being short😂,0
"I’m 5’2, 22 years old and am awaiting a PCOS and Endometriosis diagnosis. I am the epitome of skinny fat. I will walk for miles and walk all the time, as well as trying to get a regular swimming routine. I HATE the gym and will never go (and to be honest hate exercise outside of walking and swimming) do you think adding Pilates, as well as going swimming 2-3 times a week with all my walking will help? I am a vegetarian who has recently found out I’m intolerant to gluten, so navigating that as well. Any advice is appreciated! :)",0
I'm 5 ft 4 in.. Where.. Where do I go??? 🥹,0
Ive just started my weight loss journey at 85kg and 5.3ft and the first thing i decided to do was swap out some of the foods i was normally eating for the healthier version of it and using myfitnesspal to document everything i was putting in to my body and i have to say before i started i was only eating 1900 calories a day anyways and the weight really was just going on without me even noticing being short can sometimes suck 😂,0
I am 4.8 very small want to lose only bodyfat!,0
THANK YOU! I’m a 4’11 Filipino girl and it’s a struggle 🥲,0
Your face kinda reminds me of Ana De Armas,0
I did slim and 6 and a while and I did slim up a little but not seeing as much as I want to I just wanna be more tone I’m 4’11 and I’m 19 I’ve been the same weight since I was younger and it is definitely harder to lose weight I have just been doing some lower ab workouts trying to slim my lower stomach more and midsection workouts on the elliptical. But I’m glad u said that about it being harder when ur shorter but also it’s so hard to stay on a diet,0
this is probably the most helpful and informative video i've ever watched about weight loss and motivated me more than ever thank you diva <3,0
"I'm 5'2, my girl-friend is 6'0. We've both gone up and down in weight. When we go up 12lbs, people start asking me if I'm pregnant, she just gets more 'boobielicious' looking. 😑",0
Will this work for short men as well cuz there’s nothing out there for us :1,0
I wish I were taller,0
Thank you for sharing! I've been on a deficit for a while and am no longer losing weight - But I have about 4 kgs to lose until I reach my ideal weight goal. I'll try the maintenance phase you're talking about with the high protein intake and weight lifting. 🧡,0
"Ughh the thing is I’m not sure if I’m 5’3 or 5’4 😭, as a 13 year old girl",0
It’s not fair bro,0
Can streath training count as biking?,0
Bad thing worse is we can only eat like 1200 calories. The only reason I would ever want to be taller is so I could eat more lol,0
"Great, Not only am i women and i lose fat slow anyway. i am also 5'2",0
I’m 4’8. and I HATE how hard it is for me to lose weight!! 😩😿,0
Fuck im 5’2 so thats why… i literally do omad and still fat. No carbs btw,0
"What makes this ""BEGINNER FRIENDLY""? 1. I used BASIC movements, that are not super complicated or hard 2. the movements REPEAT, giving you a chance to get used to them 3. a couple of BREAKS.

@olaidesogoye really depends on your level use your smart watch if you have i dont have,0
@olaidesogoye I figured it out in an online calculator and it should be around 200kcals give or take,0
is it ok to force myself on the first day? To finish the 20 minutes workout. I did up to 10 minutes and my leg gave up 😂 This is my first time.,0
"Nur HR dude you don’t do this type of exercise if it’s your first day. Pamela Reif is hardcore. Her moves may be basic in this video, but in no way is this a good beginner workout to do. If you’re just starting out you need modified moves and atleast 5-10 second breaks inbetween. She just made a much easier Ab workout with breaks last week so try that first or give yourself 10 seconds between reps if you’re going to do this.",0
Omg I just started my wellness journey!! I’m a beginner to everything but your workouts aren’t at all intimidating and I actually feel the burn!! I’m going to do this plus yoga everyday!! Love you and thanks for the motivation #momof5 #35 hope to look and feel amazing soon!!,0

Need a intermediate / advanced version!! <3 thanks for your videos !,0
Pamela can you make a warm up video and belly flat workout video 👍👍💔,0
"@David LeSaffre it's working for me. It's very straightforward I thought. I have people commenting that I am looking more toned and I feel so much fitter. I only do this a few times a week and I also do walks and a little running. As a mum of five, I am slim trim and fitter and it feels great. Was able to do this all the way through first time I tried it. Not feeling the need to graduate from beginner's level though 😂",0
How many calories does this burn?,0
Thank you specialy it easy to do it before going to school i just need to wake up 20 min earlier . Wish me luck😉😉,0
@lyndabenba6895 you should wake up a shower time earlier too youll sweat as if you were under the rain,0

Could you do a waist workout?,0
thanks you so much for sharing this video . The first time try this so happy 😂 can't wait how the result .,0
"Hello this is the best beginning workout I've seen! :) I have a question about if the moves are too hard in the first couple of times I do this workout, can I take a longer break or do half the workout until I build up? Or will that make the workout not productive to do? Thanks much love ♥️",0
"David LeSaffre this is a free YouTube channel. She’s not your paid personal trainer. If you want that kind of guidance, maybe pay for it and don’t whine cos you can’t keep up with a YouTube video.

I love your workout so much 💔💔,0
Yes finally I didn't pause in this one thank you I love all your work outs.,0
"Thanks to Pamela Reif, this is by far the best “light, yet good” workout out there! I have bad discs in my back & not much keeps them from flaring up in terms of a good mix for strengthening, cardio & full body workout — this one though is top level. Easy on the muscles, solid boost of heart rate throughout & worthwhile stretching at the end. I’d recommend this to anyone bored with the typical jog, walk, treadmill, weight lifting routine.",0
For the First time i has a huge „muskelkater“ 😜,0
Omg this was SO hard for me to do! But I am not going to stop watching this video until this video is easy to do! Thanks so much for something that is now apart of my daily routine and challenges me 🙌🏽,0
How many calories do you burn?,0

How many calories would you think this workout burns off hand? :),0
"This literally answers all my questions I was asking before I came to the comments. I got up to attempt a squat (something I've always said I couldn't do) and I was successful. I could feel it working with the three squats I did. I don't think I did it properly, but I know that with practice, I'll get it. I'm gonna use this in the morning as my first workout in my 30 day walking challenge.",0

"Not going to speculate on whether the earned potential is legitimate, but I can say this: There's no HONEST way that I 😢 earn that kind of coin, because that would have to entail a FAIR exchange of value. There's nothing I could do to give back that kind of value so it could be honestly earned. I'm not talking about legally here I'm talking about ethically. Anyone with decent values shouldn't want to find a way to cheat others and grift undeserved income out of them. It's not just unfair, but eventually you wish you'd been more ethical and in the mean time, you don't really appreciate your I'll gotten gains. There's nothing more satisfying than earning an honest living, except perhaps finding true love.",0
No thankyou i need more than that,0
Lmao,0
YT is actively shutting down channels like this.. I get it but more so the ones that spread false info about people or news… at least these turn people onto new shows and movies 🤷‍♀️ but I agree it’s gotten out of hand,0
Do not join his discord. Its a scam.,0
You might make more if you started tagging the film title with the post. I bolck and reject channels that don't and I'm not alone.,0
Ngl i don't wanna be mean but if I wanted to make 40 dollars I month the way I r I think I would have done criminal bills to pay,0
"40 dollars a month is crap, thats like 1/5 of a day of honest work. No ty.",0
1:29:23 HOLY I GOT AN ADD ABT BARBEQUE,0
watching this with two cats curled up on my bed sobbing my eyes out,0
"To answer your question in the beginning... as much is it hurts not being able to adopt all of the cats I would adopt the black one as well because I lost my black little lady in September after 16,5 years and it reminded me of her 💔",0
4:11 I would pick 2nd or last one cus they look like my kitties,0
I just finished the game myself and I may have cried (I’m not normally emotional),0
37:07 you got some paws to throw,0
1:33:59 this part hit hard knowing i lost my cat 2 days ago,0
Why can dawn just get the collar,0
I know I'm late to watch this but as soon as the cat said I didnt know I could still purr really hit me hard 😭.,0
I HATE THIS GAME I CRIED MY EYES OUT LIKE 4 TIMES😭😭,0
jay has proven this whole video that he is in fact a dog person lmao,0
Sounds like shes got demenia.,0
Lol probably should've went for the baby bc the baby will die too. If you take baby then momma lives and has more. 😂 I feel u though.,0
"Adopting an adult cat is about patience. You've got to let them get used to things before you expect them to get comfortable. It can take seceral days to several months, and if you push them, it makes them nervous.",0
"Olive is such a horrible cat owner, poor babies",0
Ahwe poor kitty what does Mae expect? This is literally a cat bro ofc they act like that,0
"That ending is so messed up. Olive doesn't deserve those cats. I literally started bawling. I have three babies and I can't imagine being without them. 💔 😭 Edit: I'm glad Dawn made friends with the other cat and found Olive, but her dumping her was so messed up.",0
1:23:37 when she started humming his face took me out..😂,0
45 male her and i cried my eyes out playing this game. My two devon rex got more hughes than they was used of after i played this this game. Olive i hate you!,0
"No I got some, cuz why did she just leave dawn in the middle of nowhere instead of dropping her off at a shelters or some family",0
Is anyone else getting emotional for some reason?,0
"As a proud owner of three cats this mad eme upset 😭😭 How can anyone mistreat any animal, even if they're not your pets? I would never abandon my pets...",0
I think I can get the game close I have a ps5 and it's my birthday in too week's every one how likes is wishing me a happy 9th birthday.,0
I was playing this game as I was watching this,0
"5:02 could be because of how athletic they are so if like, a dog or coyote starts chasing the cat. thecat can easily climb if not declawed, but of course. the owner should form a bond first and put a tracker collar on them.",0
"This story didn’t make me cry, it made me angry. But I am glad I listened to the story of the game and respect that it was able to evoke that emotion and lead to conversations about cat ownership in the comments. I don’t think the ending of this game was a happy one, like the creators may have intended it to be, but I’m glad the story was told even with that dissonance.",0
"My theory is that the two Dawns are apart of the same litter, in Dawn's memories (player) before the car could hit her it shows three kittens in a box. What if the three kittens are apart of a litter and the two Dawns were two of those kittens, hence why they look the same but didn't know each other. They got taken to different homes when they were little and didn't grow up with each other (I say this because Dawn{the player} was shown being given as a gift to the ungrateful child and the two people saying the dog would warm up to Dawn soon and then later Dawn was found in the shelter), but then bonded with each other over their owner Olive. But, this is just a theory ""a game theory."" sorry I was a fan of Game theory .",0
Lowkey cried vigorously my mom asked me why the hell I was crying about started ugly crying before holding my cat,0
"""You'll be safer here"" CMON MAN WHAT R U ON? NO FOOD NO WATER NO SHELTER THIS AIN'T SAFE AT ALL, AT LEAST I WOULD UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE IF OLIVE LEFT DAWN AT THE ANIMAL SHELTER BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?? WTFF DUDE NOT TO MENTION THAT SHE WAS THE WORST PET OWNER LIKE YOU CAN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOUR OWN CAT? BEING OLD DOESN'T COVER UP HOW OLIVE LITERALLY LEFT THE CAT IN THE MOST UNSAFE PLACE ON THE WORLD FOR A CAT OR ANY PET REALLY AND EXPECTED DAWN TO STAY THERE? SOMEONE NEEDS TO GIVE HER THE WORST PET OWNER OF THE YEAR AWARD WTF.",0
This got me crying,0
My grandpa has dementia he's in a home now but he left the house we didn't know and he left the door open and one of my dogs left her name was daisy I don't know if she's passed or out there or what you reminded me of that,0
Omg✋😭,0
"No. Not for me. Simba is 17 now and has always been a gentle baby. He has claws but has never hurt the bunny we had nor any dogs he’s come across from mom or my sister. Blue, a cat I rescued when he was 3 now 10, has dents in his skull and can’t jump like a cat has some separation anxiety with me yet though it’s gotten much better. And it depends on the cat really. Simba warmed up to me within a few days blue a week. Blue only stole food that week because he didn’t realize he would be fed everyday I think. Now they’re both patient. We have a routine. Clothes, bathroom, then we have breakfast. They don’t steal. I think they like routine. But both are love bugs, blue is especially clingy and likes to be in whatever area I’m in. Simba is a hard sleeper and he doesn’t always notice when I move but he’s deaf now. Cats are about trust. Earn their trust and you have a lifelong friend. At least that’s my experience.",0
I cried over this video,0
That is actually a black Jaguar. Not a panther,0
Wth is a black Jaguar it's panther a black panther CAN be a Jaguar but it can be a leopard to,0
what a good ending i was not expecting that . 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 great message !!!,0
this is a very good way to show what not to do when you adopt cats or any animal for that matter . wow i am so in my feelings because of this !!!!,0
This made me have a depression episode help,0
"Almost one year ago in August my cat ran away, it was my first cat and I loved him so much. I never knew what happened to him and it destroyed me, I could never imagine abandoning a cat by free will. I hope every owner knows how much their little souls need them and love them. This game really hurt I cried 2 hours straight ☹️",0
"Love the black cat representation. I’ve had my baby girl for 15, going on 16, years, and she’s the sweetest, most lovable little fluff ball. Also, PLEASE don’t treat a stray like Olive did. If you adopt a cat and realize you can’t take care of it, take it back to the shelter. Don’t dump a cat just because you think that’s a better solution. Animals are live creatures that deserve to be loved just like we do. Dumping a cat just takes away 95% of that chance that they could find a good home. Strays are incredibly common where I live. I’ve had 8 cats and 5 kittens in my 25 years of living and all but 2 were strays that wandered up and we kept. We just had to put up 4 kittens for adoption after one of our cats got pregnant before we could get her spayed. It sucks to have to give up an animal, especially one you’re attached to, but at the end of the day, if you don’t have the time or resources to care for a cat, especially a kitten, it’s best to get them to someone who can. I’m not trying to lecture anyone here. Abandoned pets are just something sad that I see way too much where I live, so please look out for the animals you decide to take in. They deserve it.",0
"Okay this one kinda hit, almost had me tearing up n shi 😓😓",0
He missed it but on the day where olive falls to the floor with her medication in the beginning if you go to the garage it says “ it’s so dark it reminds me of that time I was in a suitcase for 2 days” when I saw that in game I almost started bawling my eyes out,0
im gonna be deadass i started sobbing,0
I played the whole game it literlly made me cry😢the ending is so sad bro even remembering this game makes me cry😭,0
"Haven’t finished watching so don’t hate on me too much but I honestly understand both of Olives and Mae’s feelings, put yourself in they’re shoes you wouldn’t want to be in a retirement home, nor could you live with yourself knowing your mom could die any second and that the cat could stress out the lady. I love animals a lot ofc but still",0
I never hated a character in any game except for this one and two at the same time. Still love and hate the game 😂,0
"I'm 8 months late but I headcanon that Olive isn't around for much longer and Dawn and Sunrise get adopted together (some shelters will mark cats as ""bonded"" to each other, meaning they have to be adopted together), and they get to live out the rest of their lives with people who genuinely love them. With some wholesome shenanigans based around how similar they look of course!",0
If this was scourges back story then he would be a great villain,0
6:59 jay looks so zesty doing this,0
"I don't understand people who replace animals with animals that look the exact same and expect the animal to be exactly like the pet they lost. I absolutely adore my cat mama, I could never imagine getting a replacement of her, no one could replace her and I always feel guilty whenever I think about even getting another cat. Even if shes still around, it feels like I'm replacing her",0
0:39 “im not really a cat person— home is not about where you live 😇.”,0
First time ive ever bawled my eyes out over a cat game 😭😭,0
I wanted the dog one,0
NO NO IM CRYING PLEASE STOP,0
seeing olive cough just makes sad idk why I feel like to cry,0
"Nah my cats have a cat flap they chill, come in whenever for naps or food or cuddles. Had toby for 8 years never had any accidents. Never been to the vet (he’s healthy don’t worry) and i have another cat Rosie who is fluffy asff and u need to brush her quite often lmao",0
0:15 Such a iconic intro fr,0
"I'm only 33 min in to the video so correct me of I'm wrong but I think the reason why the game is called ""copycat"" is because the cat you are playing as is the exact physical copy of Olive's other missing cat, so you're a replacement for Olive to fix the empty place in her heart that was meant for her missing cat. Hence the name ""copycat"".",0
Nah that's foul cuz why is the retirement house label shaped like a tombstone. 💀,0
I was almost crying at so many parts like man way to make a depressed cat but at last the cat us happy now🥲,0
"my cat drops her food into her water bowl, makes soup, and then throws it up",0
I actually cried wth😭,0
i love the meaning of this game. and in the end they both got a true home 😭😭,0
"My newest cat that i got we found under a generator at my work at a farm, her leaving that cat there reminded me of my noble",0
"Im sitting here watching this with my cats and when Olive abandoned Dawn i started sobbing, my cat who is also a black cat was found outside a stray all alone in the winter. I cant imagine the pain all those other cats feel left outside",0
"Im genuinely so mad, cause wdym you adopt a cat- a living being- the moment your former cat gets lost?? and when it comes back you dump the other one in the wild??",0
bro not even five minutes in the video and i wanna cry,0
sunrise and dawn 💕,0
I cried twice during this🥀,0
"I love Black Cats, but I’m sadly allergic to cats.",0
1:34:18 This is the 13th reason 🫡🔫,0
this is probably some cats life rn,0
I’ve had my cat for over ten years and she still scratches me whenever she doesn’t want me touching her 😭,0
"1:59:26 This part destroyed me, about 7 years ago one of my cats got lost and when we found him he had been run over and killed💔",0
"1:05:00 I have to say, they did a great job making that bluebird, although the dark blue makes it look like a male. I half expected him to fly at the cat, as I've had a pair of bluebirds diving at me before over being too close to their nest",0
"and remember the next time you see a stray cat you should try and pet it, why? Because you can always wash your hands after but that cat can't always feel love again",0
I would take that one brown cat with those stripes home it’s looks cool,0
"I cried so many times Im too sensitive 😭😭😭 ugh I cant I know its fake cats but knowing it happens in real life just overwhelms me... I can't stand that people really do this. Such disreguard for animals feelings. Its evil, cruel and narcissistic. Humans who think their lives are more important and feelings taking precident makes me so angry... animals have always treated me better than most people and I wish I could save them all.. poor babies in this world being hurt by selfish humans. And the complete ignorance to think theyre somehow doing the right thing because they cant cope with responibility and comprehending anothers feelings/needs just breaks my heart. Games like these should be played in school by children to show them why empathy and responsibility are so important. Generations later of this type of emotional exposure could change the world.",0
Idk if id forgive olive like at first you think its just a missunderstanding but then when she says she knows who you are and leaves you in the middle of nowhere it kinda makes me go yea screw her i wanna find a new home.,0
11:54 talking bout granny cakes is a crazy work😭💔,0
"1:34:10 what about food and water? you’ve eliminated any outside source of harm, but never considered how she’ll get food in such a place like this. No cars no dogs, no animals. With people, there was a chance more birds more rodents around.",0
I’m never seeing a stray cat the same way again,0
Are the bits with tide pen and ribena ads or what?,0
This is entertaining I keep coming back 🤧,0
im back here again,0
That scotch egg is overcooked,0
Why do English people eat off the back of the fork? We eat the opposite way in America,0
She's classy yet with a big heart for food. Never thought she is actually english. Im having a crush ❤,0
this is one of my favorite videos on youtube lmao,0
"I love her!! Not picking at the food, just totally savouring and enjoying it. Great, acctress, funny and beautiful ❤❤❤❤",0
"It’s 2025, and it’s still my comfort video! I hope Florence makes more such content, I love her so much.😭♥️",0
So true. Cant have a meal in that country without ketchup. 😂,0
I love this video but I always hope with all my heart that the crew ate the rest of the food because there is SO MUCH OF IT omg,0
I keep coming back to this video 😂,0
Tea is not british it's Indian 😂,0
i come back to this video so much actually im not sure why but its SO addictive to watch and just so relaxing,0
This is the only museum I keep revisiting.,0
British food = equal to what her surname sounds like.,0
It's not an english thing. It's just a cutlery etiquette thing. She being very proper for the aesthetic of the video.,0
Hey its me... Back again,0
Every year since this was last shown I would watch it like I don’t know how many times and I’m still enjoying it like it was my first time. Love Pugh❤,0
I watch it before bed as asmr nearly every night makes me super hungry for brekkie though,0
my favorite YouTube video ever,0
"vogue must do another video with her again, I simply can not watch this anymore, I fear it's not healthy how often I watch this same video",0
I need this but with Indian food,0
A bunch of British foods this about sums it up jeez,0
EVERYTHING is fried or baked..... how much oil do british ppl eat 😭😭💀💀,0
Can yall like stop using that stupid word mukbang it's the most retardedest thing ever,0
Why this video is 5 years long,0
the only consistency in my life is watching this video,0
love how we all collectively decided that this is the ultimate comfort video 🫂,0
"5:26 ""bubble and squeak"" like a pure english 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💂",0
I don't know it's just me that the time I repeat the videos is unhealthy,0
Yeah…she liked the one with some veggies,0
Wheeeeere are all the vegetables….everything is brown 😮,0
Victoria Sponge Cake is love.❤🍓,0
"no water, only drinks tea and tide pens she’s no amateur.",0
This ain't your first time here and it won't be the last,0
Every now and then I just come back here,0
Shepherd’s pie is the bees knees,0
i always find myself rewatching this LMFAO,0
Such an interesting perspective.,0
And I thought Americans ate too much heart attack food.,0
11/2025 back agian. I guess I've made it a yearly tradition lol 😂 Anyone else? ❤,0
10/10 would watch again.,0
"Late to the party, but I’m so glad to be here, I’ve watched at least 5 times. Gotta make up for lost time!",0
"The names of the foods are as interesting as the foods themselves. Also, British food tends to get a bad wrap, but all of these look delicious to me.",0
I want to go in the place,0
Im just here for my satisfying monthly watch of florence pugh eating and humming.,0
The food doesn't look tasty lol,0
I can’t stop replaying that part.,0
I can watch her all day eating different kinds of food.,0
I'M BACK HERE AGAIN MY 5TH TIME,0
1:21 A scotch egg for me has to have a runny yolk. A hard boiled scotch egg = sadness 😫,0
my grandchildren will be hearing about this video,0
"For some reason I just have to love her so much ❤🥹 Her personality, her voice and everything. I just love it ❤",0
i still hear yelena even when she's talking in her normal voice,0
Vogue needs to do a part 2 with Florence pugh 🤍😭been 5 years already,0
I hope that food isn't just thrown away,0
I know Cornwall is in England but why is it being included in English dishes? Cornish people are Celtic not English.,0
That's one dry-looking shepherd's pie.,0
i also smell everything before i eat it so thanks for being relatable !!! <3,0
Hope all the food goes to crew!!,0
"That’s awful culinary culture,poor English guys",0
The adorable way she says “Ribena!!” lives in my head rent free.,0
Who's still watching in 2025?,0
4:19 It's a snake an- SNAKE?! 😂,0
What a weird comment on a mukbang video,0
"Her Royal Majesty, Princess Irulan Corrino and this is just her morning breakfast",0
"Yes, I come back here every full moon to hear her exclaim “Bubble and Squeak??”",0
Florence making nomnomnomnom sounds is strangely calming.,0
This is my 20th time watching this huhuhu I love watching her and listening to her voice. Wish I could meet her in person.,0
A BUNCH of British foods..so American...a bunch of bananas!,0
No to the ketchup. That’s so American.,0
The humor is spot on.,0
There’s nothing British about this Gen Z imposter. No true Englander slurps tea or appears surprised at Branston.,0
I love this video and I love florejce here being herself and upholding her identity,0
"Watched this when it first came out, and i keep coming back here every now and then!",0
and we are back here again 😅😭,0
"I remember when I was in that country, they loved fish and chips.",0
Hilarius that they tryied to make this actress ugly!,0
Every abused workers dream come true.,0
Why not? Go to the theatre! Stop being lazy! It’s sam raimi so it’s probably good,0
"As someone who has worked an office job, understandable",0
Well that didn't go the way I expected it to go holy sh...,0
Rachel and Dylan???? IM SAT!,0
Loki is glad you didn't call the movie Get Help,0
I first thought by looking at the pin nail that the woman was Kaya and I was excited the two reunited again but my bad,0
How is this not a comedy.,0
Another woke DEI movie? For who? Frustrated feminists?,0
Yes a movie for all good workers,0
"This looks like a horrible, horrible movie that I wouldn't go to with free tickets.",0
I have see this! Great cast. It will be hilarious.,0
I'll watch anything Sam Raimi does. I was surprised by Drag Me To Hell because I didn't even know he directed it until after I watched it. Then the part at the end with the talking goat made so much sense xD,0
Really hoping Wilson makes his return and takes revenge for being left out at sea.,0
FINALLY GOOD CASTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEEN WAITING FOR A MOVIE LIKE THIS FOR YEARS!! Quality Casting/directing/story/colour grading etc.....,0
"I love Dylan O’ Brien, but I’m sorry… this role would’ve been perfect for Nicholas Cage",0
"I really want Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks, Cast Away) to show up.",0
Thought that was Chris Pratt at first. This also reminded me a bit of a skit by Studio C...,0
Gorl what in the lord of the flies is going on?,0
So stilinski went corporate..bumer😅,0
The movie hasn't even came out yet how could be too sure,0
Sam rami rarely misses im so pumped,0
thats how you stay away from cast sometimes,0
"And this, gentlemen, is why we don't push women over the edge 😊",0
"Rachel Mcadams returns to her crazy self, I’m so tuning in!!",0
Rachel took mean girls up a notch,0
I had to rewatch this a lot just to make sure what I was seeing was real,0
Didn't the people who made this movie see the Tv show called Man Vs Wild. Cause everyone who watched the show remembers seeing all the Women crying and didn't have any skills to survive. It Woke people believe they can make movies like this. Then I have the right to believe that I really saw BIG FOOT riding a Unicorn near my house.,0
This is giving a lot of castaway vibes,0
“Triangle of sadness”,0
I love This kind of movies,0
misery 1990 vacation version 😋,0
Send help is the call from the USA in 2025😂,0
"So, ""Triangle of Sadness"", but for dumb people.",0
"So this isn't ""The Notebook""?",0
I need to watch,0
"Rachel is brilliant just from the trailer, I nominate her for an oscar",0
"Whoa, I loved Drag Me to Hell and I love Rachel McAdams. This looks pretty crazy.",0
So “Triangle of Sadness” and “Misery” had a baby…,0
feminist ahhh movie,0
"Are u kidding me? Rachel McAdams can do any role, I am convinced now. How can her acting in a mere trailer impress me so much?? This woman is a unit!",0
"Her ability to transform and look unlike herself, as well as portray a less groomed version of herself and fool anyone into thinking she’s not still stunning is comical. This only makes me see her as an even more talented actor. Aging is a privilege.",0
"For those who've seen ""Misery,"" there you go.",0
I like how the trailer leaves us with just enough scenes in the movie to not be spoiled by what the ending is gonna be. Will either of them get off the island? Will one of them kill the other in order to escape? A trailer that leaves us with enough questions like as to how the movie will end is the BEST kind of movie trailer.,0
Kind of weird movie,0
This might be the first movie that has Dylan O'Brien as a character designed to be hated.,0
"Can’t wait to see this! Saw Dylan O’Brien recently in Twinless and absolutely loved it, been a fan since his Teen Wolf days so watching his growth as an actor is fabulous. I absolutely LOVE Rachel McAdams, she had brilliant range, this film is going to be amazing, I can just sense it.",0
I guess Regina George has finally snapped... And I am HERE for it,0
It might be good but the concept seems very contrived.,0
"first time in a LOOONG time, I'm really excited for a movie. I think this is the best duo that could ever exist in a movie.",0
"Simple. Just tell her she's beautiful, and I was mean, because I love you, I want to marry you and have children blah blah blah, then lay back and let her do all the work. Women are simple creatures",0
Well you did not see Anniversary or Ponyboi he was playing a very bad bad boy in those movies,0
I’m watching it cause Dylan O’Brien is in it. Always loved him as an actor all the way back from when he was in teen wolf. ❤,0
The fact that Rachel doesn't look like she aged and Dylan was a kid during the Notebook makes me feel old and young at the same time 😮,0
"Basically every tech bro. The worst human beings on earth, the most harmful organism to this planet, are Big Tech. CEO's.",0
"wow karma is real, regina said cady was a jungle freak, then here we are 😂",0
this looks fantastic,0
I’ll be sure to miss that one,0
The indoctrination is real,0
I love how it starts out like 50 Shades of Grey and ends like Misery lol,0
to all the boss out there this movie is for you hehehe,0
OMG I never thought we would get these both together Dylan is such a ridiculously handsome hunk ... I would love to see him onscreen ❤❤❤,0
It’s like a more thrilling version of “Cast Away”,0
"Seeing that it's releasing in January... I'm concerned, But also seeing Sam Raimi.... I'm optimistic",0
First half of the trailer: oh so they'll get stranded and have to work together to find a way off the island. like castaway. Other half of the trailer: nevermind....,0
Finally an ORIGINAL MOVIE and not a REMAKE!!!!!!!!!,0
so basically misty from yellowjackets alternate storyline 😭,0
Dylan doesn’t need survival lessons; he made three movies about it.,0
"Oh oh, you not mess with mean girls😂",0
The Kathy Bates character and the author held hostage in 'Misery',0
"Is this a gender-swapped remake of Wertmuller's Swept Away? Hey, why not?",0
have you seen triangle of sadness?,0
There's many original movies every year 🤡,0
cant wait for Send Help 2: Stuck kn space,0
This is Misery from the 80s,0
"400-450 Hollywood movies were released in 2024, most of them are not remakes. But most of those you simply aren't interested in. Worldwide, over 6700 movies were released 2024. ""Original"" doesn't mean ""good"". Also, there is no story that is completely original. All stories are derivative.",0
"Somehow this gave off some Triangle of Sadness vibes, especially concerning the power shifting dynamic featured in this trailer. Who else agrees?",0
I’m rooting for Rachel in this,0
1:30 I love how evil she’ll be to him,0
Regina George of the Jungle,0
20 years later and Rachel is back on an airplane in distress!! Looks cool,0
when i say id love to be trapped on an tropical island with rachel macadams this what i envisioned,0
This feels like if Cast Away had a baby with Misery,0
Bro literally made a movie of “Even if I were stuck on an island with you”,0
movie with the same concept: Triangle of Sadness,0
It seems very interesting I am a big fan of Sam Raimi,0
I don't think Rachel is acting in this movie😂,0
I'm ready for this one ! Soon as I seen Rachel McAdams I thought of great a romcom but she gets to show an unhinged different gear in this I see plus I'm a fan of both her and Dylan so this is a yes for me .,0
This honestly looks really stupid,0
Can’t wait to see this movie,0
Misery meets Castaway?,0
Rachel yes girl!! What a different role for her! Looks like a good one!!,0
This shows how Rachel McAdams,0
Is this some kind of Misery and Castaway mashup?,0
So the movie 'Mercy' on a dessert island,0
Why did I think this was going to be an enemy to lovers movie 😅,0
"girlboss the movie, wow hollywood really can't learn can they? I'm sure it will be a big hit, lol",0
Looks interesting to me. Hot chicks 2 unemployed island.,0
Send help but not for me!!,0
I just know this is going to be incredible. Super excited.,0
"why do they have to fight? just enjoy the great place, help each other build empire and had unli-s * x!",0
"looks corny and they stole the idea from that filipino lady who was circulating social media for a while telling her excrewmate that they aren't on the cruise ship anymore, something something toilets something something captain. anyway another lame movie that just sold the plot by making a trailer.",0
This looks fricken fantastic can't wait. Rachel we've missed you.,0
Oh this is going to be so good. Two of my favorite people and great plot 💜🩷,0
"Looked like a lovely romantic comeback for Rachel, until I saw Sam Raimi name. :popcorn-yellow-striped-smile:",0
I used to work with a guy who used the same tea bag over and over again. This movie is that tea bag.,0
I think she's gonna kill the guy,0
Kind of like cast away except with 2 people. Still a interesting story idea though,0
I'd love to be stranded on an island with her. One of my favorite actresses.,0
Got money on Rachel,0
"No boat, no kitchen..movie",0
More Fabian Socialist crap from Hollywood- the 4th turning is about to remind women how much they need men.,0
"A rotten , corrupt , rogue country with no rule of law !! Happy 250th America. You didn't make it !!",0
I get the concept but what is this even gonna be about 😂 is she like mentally torturing him or is there another bad guy on the island… I’m so confused 😂,0
Moral of this goodnight fairytale: “NO BOSSING!”😡,0
This reminds me of Triangle of sadness.,0
That man deserves every single bad thing that happens to him in this film.,0
Plot twist: She knows it’s not a secluded Island,0
Great make up crew to make Rachel McAdams look bad...,0
Terrible not even worth a download.,0
Kamala shows up in the end with her Heckle,0
"A lot of ""girl power"" individuals will definitely watch this movie. It shows a woman taking her power back and doing what's right at the same time",0
"I was kind of hoping for kissing, and this took a wrong turn. Haha",0
I will watch anything Rachel McAdams is in.,0
"And at the end, it was all a dream about her little revenge fantasy",0
Omg its Dylan from teen wolf im hyped . been hoping he gets another good movie roll letss gooo,0
Misery meets Castaway!,0
HOW HARD WOULD IT BE TO ACTUALLY FILM IT ON A ISLAND INSTEAD OF USING A GODAMN GREEN SCREEN,0
Love this woman your the best Rachel,0
"Bro, FINALLY, some original freaking ideas. Will be seeing this one",0
Red Eye: Cast Away - Wilson's Revenge,0
Freakin love Rachel McAdams! Can't wait to see this.,0
I can’t wait to see this movie . I hope it comes to prime or Netflix .,0
"script: a homely, smelly, unattractive woman who's good with numbers and the outdoors producer: get me rachel mcadams right now",0
Cast away and misery that would be very interesting,0
here before this movie before this movie becomes popular or flops,0
What a stupid - cast Away movie,0
i honestly thought this will be a rom-com coz of rachel and dylan. ooh boy.,0
Whoa! What just happened? That’s so not someone who Rachel McAdams normally plays. Interesting 🤔,0
Did anyone else see the pig's head and think Lord of the Flies? Except they replaced a pack of feral boys with one woman driven to the edge and beyond.,0
Love when they show you the whole movie in a trailer.,0
Maybe against type?,0
"I recognized him before they showed him, that voice is unmistakable hot.",0
Yuck. A movie about two people being mean to each other.,0
I predict every know-it-all assumption in this comments section will be obliterated when the movie actually comes out.,0
I hope it'll be infused with Sam Raimi's signature sense of horror–humor.,0
Might be a good movie to invite your boss to watch it tgt.,0
"A new Sam Raimi film with a solid cast, I’m in 🤘",0
I hope it is something to do with monster await them but look at the trailer. Oh! Nah. It looks bored and a psychological thriller isnt my things. Not interested. SKIP!,0
Excited for this one!,0
I hope this was a fun shoot for RMcA! It looks like it could have been a blast!,0
is he a time traveler ?,0
Oh he should be afraid of her and respect her,0
Dylan you awesome actor He is going places je is amazingly talented,0
This remake of the Blue Lagoon looks intense.,0
"Horror not my thing, at all. But when I see Sam Raimi’s name I’m all in",0
Most women lovvvvvve yuppies though.,0
How hard is it to get a real centipede? 😑 why is it CGI? And bad CGI at that?,0
thats what have become of Virginia Gorge,0
Oh we getting freaky,0

"Dan I love your videos! Thanks What do you think of just putting $100 in each New coin offering before the hype. Some will 0 ,but others will be a safemoon? My questions is how do we best choose which coins will explode? Can we reverse engineer which coins have preformed like safemoon so we can have some metrics? (I.e rate of social media buzz) ""When it launched, there were 777 trillion Safemoon tokens with a price of $0.0000000010. If you had bought $1,000 worth of Safemoon at launch, you would have had 1 trillion tokens. Safemoon has a price of $0.0000035. Your $1,000 Safemoon investment would now be worth $3.5 million""",1

Well it must be glitched for me I have 0-0-0-1-0-0-2-0,1
60451320051034005010 n repeat,1
I Just did five and got 0-0-0-0-2 so No.,1
I just got 3-1-0-2-2 so fake,1
Mine are 0-0-0-0-0-0-0 and repeat,1
I don't think thats true i just got 0-0-3-1-0-2-2-0-0-3-0-1-0-3-0-1,1
"I just got 0-1-0-3-0-1-2 hows that possible, am i blind? Or is this misinformation??",1
Your pattern is actually wrong. It is 064513200510340050106 and repeat.,1
"Cap, i just tried it I got 2-2-0-0-3",1
Not really. Because once I get 5-4-5-5-6,1
than the pattern isnt working on my account kekw😂😂 i have something like 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 and so on,1
320031030 That's what I got clearing some obstacles,1
That's not the patter for my base. the patter is 4 0 2 7 1 4 2 0 0 0 1 5 4 0 0 6 3 0 1 this patter I get ges from removing obstacles from my base.,1
Liar i got 6 6 6 5 3 3 6 in a few obstacles,1
"It's strange to know that some people don't actually know this one I thought it was a well known fact in the community, since that at the peak of Clash's life (2012-2017) it was THE top fact in every facts-related videos Man I feel old now",1
For me it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0,1
That is fake i get 6 0 3 3 6 gems,1
Well thats odd cause I just got 5-1-0-2-2 which dies not occur anywhere in this so called pattern?,1
Oh no The Pattern Is Change. Somehow I Got 2 Gems 1s. I Think The Pattern Of Gems Is 1-1-0-0-3-1-0-2-2-0-0-3-0-1-0-3-0-1-2-0 Repeat Total Of 20 Gems,1
then why did i get too much gems in just Normal trees? 5-0-0-2-1-6-9-1-0-5-8? 💀,1
Why do I get 1-0-1-1-2-0-1,1
Mine is 00050001001110044506,1
gem reward pattern : 6 0 4 5 1 3 2 0 0 5 1 0 3 4 0 0 5 0 1 0,1
and the xp points also have a pattern of 3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3 and last but not least 3,1
Mine 8-7-3-0-2-4-1,1
me getting 3-4-0-0-3,1
I think mine have a pattern too like 43023230151333413142004131302 better memorize it.,1
This is all bullshit bro i just removed some and got 4 0 5 0 2 4 0 i aint see this there stop spreading random shit around for views,1
"The only things i know after watching this is 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Yep, That's is an exp point :)",1

"I recently came across a side hustle that’s growing really fast and it’s something almost anyone with some kind of background or expertise can get into. Companies that are building AI tools need real people who actually know their stuff to help out with a few things: • Labeling data (like text, images, audio, code, or designs) • Reviewing AI outputs and pointing out what makes sense and what doesn’t • Fixing mistakes or adding context in areas like English, engineering, healthcare, law, business, architecture, and more In short, you’re basically acting as the human quality checker so the AI can “learn” properly. It’s not a quick cash grab, but it is a legitimate way to earn anywhere from $20 to $100 an hour by using the knowledge you already have. The pay depends on the type of project and your level of expertise. Some tasks are very beginner-friendly, while others require a stronger background or degree. Here’s one place to get started: https://app.alignerr.com/signin?referral-code=e82f595e-4dce-4d69-80f0-1c07ee99ff21 Tip: Most of these platforms have an onboarding process that includes things like sign-up forms, short skill tests, and sometimes ID checks or NDAs. A lot of people sign up but never finish that process, and then they’re left wondering why no projects show up. If you take the time to complete everything, you’ll actually start seeing paid opportunities come your way.",1

"Have you been wondering why you can’t seem to unlock the vault to true wealth and abundance? Does it seem like every time you get ahead, somehow the money seems to vanish so that you are struggling again? That’s proof that you are missing part of the recipe for true wealth and abundance. There is a simple recipe for attracting money and creating true wealth. But like a recipe, if you are missing ingredients, or if you use the wrong ingredients, you get something that is terrible. You might know part of the recipe for attracting money, but if you do not have the money in the bank that you want, something is missing. If you are not taking the vacations you know you deserve, and you are not living the life that you want, then your money vibration blueprint is incomplete. What does that mean?

My friend and money manifestation expert Croix Sather created this powerful and surprising video https://tinyurl.com/3jd67c2k about why most people repel money.

"Hey! Canva does allow the sale of templates. ☺️ Here’s what they say on their official website: If you want to create a product you can sell, it needs to be an original design. You can't sell any Canva content on a standalone basis. Creating an original design means using Canva Content with a combination of design elements (e.g. images, videos, audio files, other media, text, illustrations, background features, etc. ) and editing techniques to make a ""new"" creative work. You can sell templates under certain conditions. * The templates need to be an original design. You can use a combination of Free and Pro Content. * You can only use Pro Content in template designs if they’re shared as Canva template links (e.g. a template that brings your customers back to design in Canva). Here’s the official source for reference: https://www.canva.com/help/using-canva-to-create-products-for-sale/#:~:text=You%20can%20sell%20templates%20under,back%20to%20design%20in%20Canva). And honestly, if this weren’t allowed, we probably wouldn’t see so many creators offering Canva templates across platforms ☺️",1

"I hold high respect for your work mate because you're pointing people in the right direction. If there's one thing I've learnt recently is to remain calm especially when it comes to investment in cryptocurrency. Let's not panic and sell when when everything goes down and do not buy in euphoria when everything goes up. I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profits now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. The trade market is unstable and you can't easily tell if it's going bullish or bearish. While Myself and my colleagues are trading without fear of incurring loses, others are being patient for the price of skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow.

":stayhome:The <Bitcoin price has completed several bullish movements over the past week that may confirm a new bullish expansion phase which is about to begin . Eyes are still on what happens above the current local highs, not below, even as BTC price action is up 6% in a week. We cannot predict bottoms, but it was obvious things were getting ready to go down. Why are people JUST NOW realizing the market is bearish? Extremely bearish. Point is, be patient, and just trade to build capital for when we do bottom. Don’t let these institutions destroy you. And my advice, don’t spread yourself thin with too many coins. Market moves as a whole right now, red days mean red days for almost everything, Green Days will be the same. Paper gains and losses are normal throughout the investing cycle. Continue to invest and trade, don’t panic.’. Still love the trading techniques and advice . Digital currencies continue to reshape the world globally. It's hard for anyone who is against it right now. But from a trader's point of view, I think we really need more experts in this field to give newbies a sense of how the community works. I was able to easily increase my portfolio in just trading with Larry Curtis daily signals growing 0.5 BTC to 1.1 BTC. His daily signals are very accurate and yields a great positive return on investment and is available to give assistance to anyone who love crypto trading, you can contact him for inquires and profitable trading systems on Telegram @larrycoinsfxbitrade. ** for any crypto related issues .stayhome.,",1

":yt::buffering:As expected, Bitcoin hit an all -time high. The long volatile uptrend is expected to start now as I expect Bitcoin to peak around Christmas. We often see altcoin follow in the next two weeks when Bitcoin moves, which may explain the recent spike in Ethereum and Solana.
